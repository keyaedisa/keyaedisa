### Welcome to my Github ðŸ‘‹

- I am 24 years old
- My prounouns are: they/them
- I have left the linux community and now do darwin things. If that sounds like you lets be friends!
- I provide my iso builder as a package in my repo (https://github.com/keyaedisa/abs). It can build custom arch isos, vanilla arch isos, and more.
- I wrote the scripts in abs (archiso-build-system) from scratch. I plan to rewrite in C as apart of a broader project thats under wraps.
- Now that my website is up (keyaedisa.world), check it out!
- I'm looking to get involved with iOS security research so if you are familiar with that and would like to collab do let me know.
- If you are looking for someone to write something for you feel free to reach out.
